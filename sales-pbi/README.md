## Dataset

Source: Kaggle – International Sales Dataset

The original raw CSV files exceed GitHub's file size limits and are therefore not stored in this repository.

To reproduce this project:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Place the files in the `sales-pbi/raw-data` folder
3. Open the Power BI file included in this project

The cleaned and transformed data is handled inside Power BI using Power Query.
